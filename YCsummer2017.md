# Application to YC - Summer 2017

## Organization name

DAISEE ('Decentralized Autonomous Interconnected Systems for Energy Efficiency')

## Organization url

daisee.org

## If you have a demo, what's the url? For non-software, demo can be a video

https://youtu.be/0HY-8BucZd8

## Describe your organization in 50 characters or less.

Community-owned energy microgrids research initiative.

## What will your organization do? 

DAISEE has the ambition to bring energy door-to-door, like the internets have brought information (and so much more) at our doorstep, either from a centralized system or just from your neighbour. We want to foster resilient decentralized, secured and trusted energy infrastructures giving the power to the "prosumers" to freely decide how to share energy.

## Which category best applies to your organization? 

Energy.

## Where do you live now, and where would the organization be based after YC? 

Now: Lyon, France. Base: where it's relevant. San Francisco appears to be one of the most relevant place given the renewable energy context and energy transition path, as well as the technological, entrepreneurial and experimental culture of the region. 

# Founders

* Samira Rabaaoui
* Nicolas Loubet
* Xavier Lavayssière

Actually, DAISEE is a common (like free/open source projects). Beyound founders, we consider: 
* Core team members:
* Founders + Clement Epie: technology strategist and Louis Villard: sofware programming

Active contributors:
* Paul Flipo: harware design/architecture
* Sylvain Pastor: hardware manufacturing
* Aude Omerin: open design and business
* Alizee Gerard: transition/systemic design
* Timothée Gosselin: open source business

## Please tell us about an interesting project, that two or more of you created together.

We have been working together for the past 3 years in the context of 'La MYNE' (http://lamyne.org) a community-driven innovation space that explores sustainability and transition issues through a variety of projects and workshops. As an example, in January 2017 we organized the 'Open City Lab' workshop (http://movilab.org/index.php?title=Portail%3ADm1TL) to foster a dozens of projects for the International Biennale of Design in Saint-Etienne (http://www.biennale-design.com/saint-etienne/2017/en/programme/?ev=l-experience-tiers-lieux-14&type=exposition_in&thema=&d=) that is being held right now and for which we've been co-curators.

## How long have the founders known one another and how did you meet? Have any of the founders not met in person? 

We all know each other for 1+ years but I would rather not answer to "how long" by a time-related answer but more on projects and experiences sharing basis: time does not account for much, shared experience does. As part of those experiences there was http://lamyne.org , http://lyon.beyondlab.org/ , http://lapaillasse.org/ and many more around DAISEE that you'll found here : https://github.com/DAISEE (Hackaday Prize, EtnaCamp, Blockfest, CompteurConnect, etc.)

# Progress

## How far along are you? 

1/ We've built a first version of a prototype of peer-to-peer energy sharing system during Hackaday Prize Challenge (https://hackaday.io/project/10879/logs); it gave us the opportunity to win a prize and being ranked in the first 100 projects among about 1500. 

2/ We've built a community of contributors with more than 15 regular, 50 punctual or indirect, more than 50 potential direct contributors and 20 organizations. 

3/ We are shaping concrete field experiments, first with Prats de Mollo, a small town in South of France who manages his energy distribution.

## How long have each of you been working on this? Have you been part-time or full-time? 

It's been almost a year that we're working on DAISEE (from January to October as part of the Hackaday Prize) and since November as part of a community-driven research program at la MYNE. We have been part-time (aside from our respective jobs) from January to December 2016. Since January 2017 we are 2 full-time on it (Samira and I). Louis will be full-time in the coming months and Nicolas is mainly dedicated to the DAISEE dynamics.

## Which of the following best describes your progress? 

Prototype. And we're engaged to a deployment in a small town.

## Do you have revenue? 

No

## How much money do you spend per month?

0€

## How much money does your company have in the bank now?

0€

## How long is your runway?

A few months for the founders and most of the core team members... But as knowledge produced is a common, anybody in the world is able to pursue and enrich the initiative.

## If you've applied previously with the same idea, how much progress have you made since the last time you applied? Anything change? 

NA

## If you have already participated or committed to participate in an incubator, "accelerator" or "pre-accelerator" program, please tell us about it.

# Idea

Why did you pick this idea to work on?  Do you have domain expertise in this area?  How do you know this is going to work? 
Energy grids around the world are oversized, not optimized, widely poorly maintain and not resilient in terms of technology, governance, financing and investment. Coupled with industrial convergence and emerging technologies, the actual framework makes it possible to think and developed transparent distributed energy infrastructures as (a) commons. It's a long-run critical design issue that necessitates to design and deploy new types of governance and organisation.

We have top expertise in energy area but also in open soure communy building buildind, service design, software programming, hardware prototyping, law understanding and entrepreneurship. We don't have 'grid expertise' but we are working with organizations that do have this expertise.

## What's new about what you plan to do? 

We're thinking energy micro-grids in the paradigm of commons: physical infrastructures (in territories) and digital assets (code, data) are powered and ruled by autonomous communities

# Formation

## Have you incorporated, or formed any legal entity (like an LLC) yet? 

NA

## Have you obtained your 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status yet? 

NA

## Please provide any other relevant information about the structure or formation of the company. 

We plan to incorporate in the US and apply for the 501(c)(3) status.

# Others

## If you had any other ideas you considered applying with, please list them. One may be something we've been waiting for.

NA

## Please tell us something surprising or amusing that one of you has discovered. 

I am from Reunion Island, a french territory near Madagascar. During the course of our various sustainability projects, and more specifically over the various DAISEE meetings, it turns out that most of the people have at least one relative coming from or related to Reunion Island! We came to the conclusion that, apart from revealing an underlying wide spread reunionnese mafia, islands, as over constrained territories, gather the top notched people working and highly engaged in autonomy and sustainability related projects. Or, another explanation could be that as a reunionnese I am more proned to attrack, people from Reunion island. 

# Curious

## What convinced you to apply to Y Combinator? 

First, we think that YC is the best partner of the world to co-produce an ambitious and long term research and entrepreneurship program on energy transition that hybrids new technologies and old infrastructures. Secondly, we think that California is a perfect territory to deploy DAISEE! 

## How did you hear about Y Combinator? 

We know YC from long time (~ 2008-2009). But to be honest, it's Nicolas Toper (alumni from YC) that encourage us to candidate to the next batch as a non-profit
